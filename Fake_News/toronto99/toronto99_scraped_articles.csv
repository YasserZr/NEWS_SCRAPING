Trudeau gov’t to invest over $300 million into questionable meat alternatives,"The Liberal government is working to develop and promote alternatives to meat.Justin Trudeau‘s government plans to invest $323,000,000 of taxpayer dollars to develop alternatives to traditional meat.The program is titledCanada’s Protein Industries Cluster, and is using tax-payer money to tamper with plant genetics and produce plant-based alternatives to meat.This is in lockstep with policies that are promoted by the World Economic Forum (WEF), based out of Switzerland.Anarticlepublished on the WEF’s website on 2021 extols the perceived virtues of meat alternatives, opening with:Switching en masse to a plant-based diet is essential to protect wildlife habitats and prevent the loss of numerous species currently facing extinction.”While plant-based meats may be of some benefit to the world, critics have raised concerns about the practice, citing job losses for the meat industry.Others have fairly pointed out the perceived influence of the WEF on Canadian politicians, particularly Trudeau.Conservative Party leaderPierre Poilievre, the likely next prime minister of Canada, has stopped short on weighing in on this program.However, he has been outspoken against the WEF, vowing to forbid any of his MPs from the visiting the yearly conference in Davos.Did you like this article?
