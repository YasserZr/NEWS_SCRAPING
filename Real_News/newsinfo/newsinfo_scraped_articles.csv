Agence France-PresseSEOUL — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol was still clinging to power Thursday, with his party announcing they will oppose an opposition impeachment motion put forward after his stunning but brief imposition of martial law.Yoon suspended civilian rule late Tuesday and deployed troops and helicopters to parliament only for lawmakers to vote down the measure and force him into a U-turn in a night of protests and drama.Article continues after this advertisementSeoul’s allies were alarmed — Washington said it found out via television — and on Wednesday, the opposition filed an impeachment motion saying Yoon “gravely violated the constitution and the law”.FEATURED STORIESGLOBALNATIONAbducted US vlogger believed dead, body still missing – policeGLOBALNATIONUS Court warns PH defendants in Bangladesh heist to answer rapsGLOBALNATIONTrump names billionaire private astronaut as next Nasa chiefREAD:Why did S.

Korean democracy’s strengthIf the motion passes, Yoon will be suspended pending a verdict by the Constitutional Court. If the judges give the nod, Yoon will be impeached and new elections must happen within 60 days.Bad memoriesYoon, who has lurched from crisis to crisis since taking office in 2022, has not been seen in public since his televised address in the early hours of Wednesday.On Thursday, his office said that Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun had resigned, but other key allies including Interior Minister Lee Sang-min remain in office.Yoon’s martial law declaration was the first in more than four decades in South Korea and brought back painful memories of the country’s turbulent past.The move was to “safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea’s communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements plundering people’s freedom and happiness,” Yoon said.A six-point decree from the army chief banned political activities and parties, “false propaganda”, strikes and “gatherings that incite social unrest”.Security forces sealed the National Assembly, helicopters landed on the roof and almost 300 soldiers tried to lock down the building, seemingly to prevent lawmakers from entering.But as parliamentary staffers blocked the soldiers with sofas and fire extinguishers, enough MPs — some leaping over barriers — got inside and voted down Yoon’s move.This brought cheers from the hundreds of protesters braving bitter temperatures outside, many waving national flags and chanting for Yoon to be arrested.‘Unforgivable’Lawmakers formally presented the impeachment motion in the early hours of Thursday, saying Yoon’s decision to impose martial law was intended to “evade imminent investigations… into alleged illegal acts involving himself and his family”.“This is an unforgivable crime — one that cannot, should not, and will not be pardoned,” MP Kim Seung-won said.The main opposition Democratic Party has also filed a complaint of “insurrection” against the president, ministers and top military and police officials — which can carry a penalty of life imprisonment or even death.In a show of public anger, thousands of protesters converged around Yoon’s office in Seoul late Wednesday after staging a rally in Gwanghwamun Square, demanding his resignation.‘Robust and resilient’The United States has around 30,000 troops stationed in North Korea to help protect its ally against the nuclear-armed North.US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Wednesday that Yoon’s imposition of martial law “raised deep concern for us” while praising the National Assembly for operating “according to constitutional processes and procedures” to rescind it.“South Korea’s democracy is robust and resilient, and we’re going to continue to speak out publicly and engage privately with South Korean counterparts to reinforce the importance of that continuing,” Sullivan said.China, a key ally of nuclear-armed North Korea, urged its citizens to exercise caution, while Russia — increasingly close to Pyongyang — called the situation “alarming”.Your subscription could not be saved.

Korean democracy’s strength,"A citizen watches reports regarding the declaration and subsequent lifting of martial law at an electronics store in Yongsan-gu, Seoul. (Yonhap via The Korea Herald/Asia News Network)SEOUL — South Korea’s extreme political polarization and acrimony put its democracy to the test when President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law late Tuesday, in an apparent preemptive move to prevent opposition parties from stymieing his presidency with budget cuts and the impeachment of key officials.In such a crisis, democratic institutions demonstrated their resilience, a strength that has safeguarded the country’s young, but vibrant democracy, experts and observers said Wednesday.Article continues after this advertisementPolitical commentator Park Chang-hwa said that, in the end, the swift resolution of the martial law standoff within just six hours was the result of both the parliamentary system’s checks and balances and the people’s right to resist.FEATURED STORIESGLOBALNATIONAbducted US vlogger believed dead, body still missing – policeGLOBALNATIONUS Court warns PH defendants in Bangladesh heist to answer rapsGLOBALNATIONTrump names billionaire private astronaut as next Nasa chiefREAD:Why did S. Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol resort to martial law?“During the process of blocking the martial law declaration, the media closely scrutinized events, the National Assembly convened swiftly, and when lawmakers climbed fences and engaged in physical struggles, citizens stepped in to support them,” he told The Korea Herald. “Because all of this happened quickly, the situation could be contained at an early stage.”Article continues after this advertisementAt 10:28 p.m. on Tuesday, Yoon declared martial law in an urgent public address. The military immediately transitioned to a martial law command structure and issued orders which, among other things, prohibited “all political activities, including the activities of the National Assembly, local councils, political parties and political associations, as well as assemblies and demonstrations,” and placed all media and publications under the control of the martial law command.Article continues after this advertisementThe parliament moved swiftly.Article continues after this advertisementThe speaker of the National Assembly, Woo Won-shik, said, “The National Assembly will respond in accordance with constitutional procedures,” and appealed to his fellow lawmakers: “All members of the National Assembly, please convene in the plenary chamber immediately.”READ:What unfolded on Tuesday night in Seoul: A timelineArticle continues after this advertisementThe leaders of the ruling and opposition parties, who are usually at odds, joined forces, strongly criticizing Yoon’s decree.Han Dong-hoon, leader of the ruling People Power Party, stated, “The president’s declaration of martial law is wrong.” Lee Jae-myung, leader of the Democratic Party, echoed, “The people did not authorize President Yoon’s martial law.”By 1 a.m. Wednesday, the Assembly passed a resolution demanding the revocation of martial law with unanimous support from the 190 lawmakers present.“I truly believe it was the people who stopped it,” Park said. “If the aides and the public hadn’t been able to block it, there could have been a situation where a few lawmakers were detained, resulting in a lack of a majority. If that had happened, it’s hard to imagine what could have unfolded.”The events highlighted both the strengths and weaknesses of South Korea’s democratic system. While the swift actions of media, lawmakers and citizens showcased the vitality of its institutions, experts argue the Constitution’s provisions on martial law remain vulnerable to misuse.Experts stated that despite the current situation not being a wartime scenario as defined by the Constitution, the president’s arbitrary interpretation could once again instill fear and anxiety among the public.“This incident reveals the need for constitutional reform,” said Shin Yul, a political science professor at Myongji University. “The process for lifting martial law must be more immediate, and safeguards against arbitrary declarations should be strengthened.”Also, the intensifying acrimony between Yoon and his liberal foes in the parliament, leading up to Tuesday’s martial law declaration, underscored a critical absence of political dialogue and compromise – a key element essential for any functioning democracy.Ever since Yoon’s inauguration, South Korea has seen a recurring cycle of the opposition’s unilateral passage of contentious bills and Yoon’s persistent use of veto power.Your subscription could not be saved.

Why did S. Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol resort to martial law?,"A citizen watches President Yoon Suk Yeol declare martial law on Tuesday night at Seoul Staion. (Yonhap via The Korea Herald/Asia News Network)SEOUL — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s declaration of emergency martial law on Tuesday has sparked widespread criticism, marking the first time in over 40 years that such a measure has been invoked. Political experts suggest that the unprecedented move is rooted in Yoon’s increasing political isolation, compounded by numerous scandals, legislative gridlock and growing tensions with both opponents and allies.Park Chang-hwan, a political commentator and professor at Jangan University, described the martial law declaration as “a frantic last-ditch effort.” He argued that Yoon’s mounting conflicts and diminishing political support likely drove him to make what Park called “extreme choices.”Article continues after this advertisement“The fact that the president declared martial law without consulting his advisors shows an apparent psychological state of isolation.

The impeachment motion alleges that the officials failed properly to investigate Yoon’s wife, first lady Kim Keon-hee, over allegations of stock manipulation.Article continues after this advertisementThe Democratic Party of Korea, which holds the majority of seats in the National Assembly, has accused Choe and other prosecutors of bias and negligence in their handling of investigations of allegations against the first lady.

Since then, Yoon’s administration has struggled to pass its agenda, instead repeatedly vetoing the bills passed by the liberal opposition.Article continues after this advertisementFalling approval, internal conflictsYoon’s approval ratings have plummeted to around 17 percent, driven by a series of scandals, including allegations that the first lady accepted gifts such as a luxury Christian Dior bag worth 3 million won ($2,200) and participated in a stock price manipulation scheme. Last month, Yoon issued a public apology but refused to authorize a wider investigation into the allegations, further fueling opposition criticism.READ:South Korea’s opposition move to impeach President YoonArticle continues after this advertisementCompounding his troubles, Yoon has reportedly clashed with Han Dong-hoon, chair of the ruling People Power Party and once a key ally. This internal conflict has deepened Yoon’s political isolation, leaving him increasingly embattled.“Yoon’s growing isolation within his own party and the opposition’s relentless pursuit of accountability have driven him to extreme measures,” Park noted.In his televised address announcing his martial law decree, Yoon claimed the move was necessary to protect South Korean citizens from “anti-state forces and pro-North Korea followers.” He accused his political opponents of paralyzing the government by impeaching key officials and obstructing his administration’s agenda.“I will eradicate anti-state forces and normalize the country as soon as possible,” Yoon declared. Critics argue that Yoon’s rhetoric is an attempt to frame the opposition as enemies of the state, further polarizing the already divided political landscape.Political observers warn that Yoon’s use of martial law could set a dangerous precedent, undermining democratic norms and eroding public trust.Your subscription could not be saved.

South Korea’s opposition move to impeach President Yoon,"Protesters stage a rally to demand South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol to step down in front of the National Assembly in Seoul, South Korea, Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. The signs read “Punish.” (Associated Press Photo/Ahn Young-joon)SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea’s opposition parties moved Wednesday to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over the shocking and short-lived declaration of martial law that drew heavily armed troops to encircle parliament before lawmakers climbed walls to reenter the building and unanimously voted to lift his order.Impeaching Yoon would require the support of two-thirds of parliament, and at least six justices of the nine-member Constitutional Court would have to endorse it to remove him. The motion to impeach, submitted jointly by the main liberal opposition Democratic Party and five smaller opposition parties, could be put to a vote as early as Friday.Article continues after this advertisementYoon’s senior policy advisers and Defense Minster Kim Yong Hyun offered to resign as the nation struggled to make sense of what appeared to be a poorly conceived stunt.

But martial law lasted only about six hours, ending after the National Assembly voted to overrule Yoon and his Cabinet formally lifted it before daybreak Wednesday.READ:South Korea’s opposition parties hint at immediate impeachment of YoonArticle continues after this advertisementDemocratic Party lawmakers, who hold a majority in the 300-seat parliament, called on Yoon to quit immediately or they would take steps to impeach him.Article continues after this advertisementYoon’s martial law declaration “was a clear violation of the constitution. It didn’t abide by any requirements to declare it,” a party statement said. The order “was originally invalid and a grave violation of the constitution. It was a grave act of rebellion and provides perfect grounds for his impeachment.”Article continues after this advertisementWhat happens if Yoon is impeached?Impeaching him would require support from 200 National Assembly members. The Democratic Party and other small opposition parties together have 192 seats. But they could seek additional votes from Yoon’s ruling conservative People Power Party.The 190-0 vote that rejected martial law included the votes of 18 lawmakers from the PPP, according to National Assembly officials. Party leader Han Dong-hun and Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon, also a member, criticized Yoon’s martial law declaration.Article continues after this advertisementIf Yoon is impeached, he will be stripped of his constitutional powers until the Constitutional Court rules. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who holds the No. 2 position in the South Korean government, would take over presidential responsibilities. Han issued a public message pleading for patience and calling for Cabinet members to “fulfill your duties even after this moment.”The Constitutional Court has only six incumbent justices following three retirements. That means all six must approve the impeachment motion for it to succeed. The court includes justices appointed after Yoon took office, so the Democratic Party is expected to speed up the process of exercising its right to recommend two of the three new justices.Yoon’s martial law declaration, the first of its kind in more than 40 years, harkened back to South Korea’s past military-backed governments when authorities occasionally proclaimed martial law and other decrees that allowed them to station soldiers, tanks, and armored vehicles on streets or at public places such as schools to prevent anti-government demonstrations. Until Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, such scenes of military intervention had not been seen since South Korea achieved a democracy in the late 1980s.People hold candles during a candlelight vigil against South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in Seoul, South Korea, Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. (Associated Press Photo/Lee Jin-man)Dramatic hours at South Korea’s parliamentAfterYoon’s declaration of martial law, troops carrying full battle gear, including assault rifles, tried to keep protesters away from the National Assembly as military helicopters flew overhead and landed nearby. One soldier pointed his assault rifle at a woman who was among protesters outside the building demanding that the martial law be lifted.It wasn’t clear how the 190 lawmakers were able to enter a parliamentary hall tovote down Yoon’s martial law decree. Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung and National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik were seen climbing over walls. As troops and police officers blocked some from entering, they didn’t aggressively restrain or use force against others.No major violence was reported. The troops and police personnel were later seen leaving the grounds of the National Assembly after the parliamentary vote to lift the martial law. Woo said: “Even with our unfortunate memories of military coups, our citizens have surely observed the events of today and saw the maturity of our military.”READ:What next for South Korea’s Yoon after failed martial law attempt?Under South Korea’s constitution, the president can declare martial law during “wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states” that require the use of military force to restrict the freedom of press, assembly and other rights to maintain order. Many observers question whether South Korea is currently in such a state.The constitution also states that the president must oblige when the National Assembly demands the lifting of martial law with a majority vote.A presidential official said Yoon decided to impose martial law to resolve a political deadlock and did it in the middle of night to minimize its effect on the economy. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the issue.Some experts say Yoon clearly violated the constitution. While martial law allows “special measures” to restrict individual freedoms and the authority of agencies and courts, the constitution does not permit the functions of parliament to be restricted.But in following Yoon’s martial law declaration on Tuesday, the South Korean military proclaimed that parliamentary activities were suspended and deployed troops to try to block lawmakers from entering the National Assembly.READ:Full text of South Korean President Yoon agreeing to lift martial lawPark Chan-dae, the Democratic Party’s floor leader, called for Yoon to be immediately investigated on charges of rebellion over the way he deployed troops to the parliament. While the president mostly enjoys immunity from prosecution while in office, the protection does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason.In Seoul, the streets were busy Wednesday, like a normal weekday.Tourist Stephen Rowan, from Brisbane, Australia, who was touring Gyeongbokgung Palace, said he was not concerned. He heard about calls for the president’s resignation and expected demonstrations.“I would have been concerned if martial law had stayed enforced,” he said.Your subscription could not be saved.

A top White House official on Wednesday said at least eight US telecom firms and dozens of nations have been impacted by a Chinese hacking campaign. —AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato, FileWASHINGTON, DC — A top White House official on Wednesday said at least eight US telecom firms and dozens of nations have been impacted by a Chinese hacking campaign.Deputy national security adviser Anne Neuberger offered new details about the breadth of the sprawling Chinese hacking campaign that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans.Article continues after this advertisementNeuberger divulged the scope of the hack a day after the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued guidance intended to help root out the hackers and prevent similar cyberespionage in the future.

JD Vance, along with people associated with Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris.The number of countries impacted by the hack is currently believed to be in the “low, couple dozen,” according to a senior administration official.The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said they believed the hacks started at least a year or two ago.The suggestions for telecom companies released Tuesday are largely technical in nature, urging encryption, centralization and consistent monitoring to deter cyber intrusions.If implemented, the security precautions could help disrupt the operation, which has been dubbed Salt Typhoon, and make it harder for China or any other nation to mount a similar attack in the future, experts say.Neuberger pointed to efforts that have been made to beef up cybersecurity in the rail, aviation, energy and other sectors following the May 2021 ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline.“So, to prevent ongoing Salt typhoon type intrusions by China, we believe we need to apply a similar minimum cybersecurity practice,” Neuberger said.Your subscription could not be saved.

According to the list, her name is pronounced CHAP-uhl ROHN, not SHA-pel ROW-an.Article continues after this advertisementLeft tongue-tiedDuring Harris’ unsuccessful run for president this year, her great-nieces took to the stage at the Democratic National Convention to clear up how to say her first name, pronounced COM-a-la. Also making the list was US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, whose last name still leaves people tongue-tied. During his 2020 presidential run, his campaign made posters and T-shirts with the pronunciation “Boot-Edge-Edge” to help.Article continues after this advertisementOther words on the list include:Article continues after this advertisement• Dutch Kooikerhondje, pronounced COY-ker-HUND-che, is a breed of dog that made it’s way into the lexicon this year. This is largely because Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani has a Kooikerhondje called Decoy who won the hearts of fans while delivering a ceremonial first pitch.• The name of the actress Zendaya, who starred in “Challengers,” is often mispronounced as zen-DIE-uh, but it should be zen-DAY-a.Article continues after this advertisement• Online fast-fashion giant Shein is SHE-in, not SHEEN.• Newly discovered exoplanet Speculoos-3b is pronounced SPEK-yuh-lohss three bee.• Phryge, the mascot of the Paris Olympics, is pronounced FREE-je.

The key to pronouncing them correctly, she said, would probably just be hearing them spoken, she said.“There aren’t really tricks short of knowing how orthology works in that language,” she said.Several of the words on the US list, including Keoghan, Phryge and Shein, also made the list for the UK, which Babbel compiled with the help of the British Institute of Verbatim Reporters, an organization for subtitling professionals.Keep tryingOther words on the UK list include flygskam, a Swedish term pronounced FLEEG-skam, popularized by climate activist Greta Thunberg, which translates as “flight shame,” and the Chagos Islands, pronounced CHAY-goss, which made the list after the British government this year returned sovereignty of the long-contested Indian Ocean archipelago to Mauritius.Touma, a native Spanish speaker, said if you can’t pronounce a word, it’s important to just keep trying.“One of the problems we have is our mouths are not trained to do these sounds that come from different languages,” he said.Touma admitted even he struggles with some words, including Harris’ first name. Even though he knows the correct pronunciation, he said, it’s hard to get it correct in the moment when he’s in a conversation.As Roan’s music gained popularity over the year, it was interesting cultural moment to watch as people learned to pronounce her first and last name, he said.Your subscription could not be saved.

Babies to have nationality of PH surrogate moms convicted in Cambodia,"Skyline of Phnom Penh, capital of Cambodia —Photo by Tang Chhin Sothy/Agence France-PresseMANILA, Philippines — Thirteen Filipino women recruited to be surrogate mothers in Cambodia have been convicted of human trafficking-related crimes. What happens now to the soon-to-be-born babies?Justice Undersecretary Nicholas Ty told reporters on Wednesday that while the Philippine officials are still discussing the babies’ fate with their Cambodian counterparts, Manila had already communicated its position that the children would be considered Filipinos.Article continues after this advertisement“Under our law, it’s simple: the woman who gives birth to the child is the child’s mother, and her nationality will be followed,” said Ty, head of the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking (Iacat) in the Philippines.FEATURED STORIESGLOBALNATIONAbducted US vlogger believed dead, body still missing – policeGLOBALNATIONUS Court warns PH defendants in Bangladesh heist to answer rapsGLOBALNATIONTrump names billionaire private astronaut as next Nasa chiefREAD:13 Filipinas get 2-yr sentence in Cambodia for violating surrogacy banBased on the informal discussions, Ty said, the Cambodian government’s primary concern is the welfare of the children since they are the real victims in the case.Article continues after this advertisementChallenges ahead“They don’t want the situation where, if they hand over the children to us, they are given to the mothers and sold by the mothers. That’s what they want to avoid because our fellow citizens were charged for [trying to] sell the children,” he said.Article continues after this advertisementTy said they would process the babies’ birth certificates in the Philippine Embassy in Phnom Penh if Cambodia agrees with Manila’s position.Article continues after this advertisement“There is a big possibility that once the children are brought to the Philippines, we will refer them to the [Department of Social Welfare and Development] and [National Authority for Child Care] to assess the best options for them. They will study whether it would be better for the children to be placed for adoption,” he said.One of the 13 pregnant women has already given birth to twins, so the total expected babies is likely 14.Article continues after this advertisementTy cited potential challenges, like the possibility that the children are carried by Filipino women in the womb but are not biologically related to them, or that the surrogates do not share the same DNA since the eggs used were not theirs.The DOJ official was referring to gestational surrogacy, a process where the surrogate mother carries and gives birth to a child that is not biologically related to her, as the egg is provided by the intended mother or a donor, while the sperm came from the intended father or a donor.Reduced sentencesTy said the government is concerned as to whether the surrogate mothers will be willing to accept the babies in such situations.The Iacat, through the embassy, also confirmed the Kandal Provincial Court’s decision dated Dec. 2, which found the 13 women guilty of violating Cambodia’s 2008 Law on the Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation.Cambodian authorities imposed a four-year prison sentence on the women. But they could be allowed to serve only two years unless convicted of another crime in the country.The surrogate mothers initially faced a sentence of 15 to 20 years for intending to sell the babies, but the lawyers worked to have their sentence reduced.“This is the best outcome the Cambodian government could offer us,” Ty said.The 13 women were among 20 Filipinos arrested by Cambodian authorities in September. Seven of them, who were not yet pregnant, were repatriated to the Philippines on Oct. 23 without facing any charges, Department of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Eduardo de Vega told the Inquirer on Tuesday.Your subscription could not be saved.

A minimum of 288 were needed.Article continues after this advertisementPresident Emmanuel Macron insisted he will serve the rest of his term until 2027.

That’s what I’m sure of,” he said.Article continues after this advertisementOpposition to Barnier’s proposed budgetWednesday’s crucial vote rose from fierce opposition to Barnier’s proposed budget.The National Assembly, France’s lower house of parliament, is deeply fractured, with no single party holding a majority. It comprises three major blocs: Macron’s centrist allies, the left-wing coalition New Popular Front, and the far-right National Rally. Both opposition blocs, typically at odds, are uniting against Barnier, accusing him of imposing austerity measures and failing to address citizens’ needs.Article continues after this advertisementSpeaking on TF1 television after the vote, National Rally leader Marine Le Pen said “we had a choice to make, and our choice is to protect the French” from a “toxic” budget.Le Pen also accused Macron of being “largely responsible for the current situation,” adding that “the pressure on the President of the Republic will get stronger and stronger.”Speaking at the National Assembly ahead of the vote, hard-left lawmaker Eric Coquerel had called on the government to “stop pretending the lights will go out,” noting the possibility of an emergency law to levy taxes from Jan. 1, based on this year’s rules.“The special law will prevent a shutdown. It will allow us to get through the end of the year by delaying the budget by a few weeks,” Coquerel said.Macron to pick a new prime ministerMacron must appoint a new prime minister, but the fragmented parliament remains unchanged. No new legislative elections can be held until at least July, creating a potential stalemate for policymakers.Macron said discussions about him potentially resigning were “make-believe politics” during a trip to Saudi Arabia earlier this week, according to French media reports.“I’m here because I’ve been elected twice by the French people,” Macron said. He was also reported as saying: “We must not scare people with such things. We have a strong economy.”Impact on financial marketsWhile France is not at risk of a U.S.-style government shutdown, political instability could spook financial markets.France is under pressure from the European Union to reduce its colossal debt. The country’s deficit is estimated to reach 6% of gross domestic product this year and analysts say it could rise to 7% next year without drastic adjustments. The political instability could push up French interest rates, digging the debt even further.Carsten Brzeski, global chief of macro at ING Bank, said uncertainty over France’s future government and finances is deterring investment and growth. “The impact of France not having a government would clearly be negative for the growth of France and hence the Eurozone,” Brzeski said.France has seen bond market borrowing costs rise, bringing back ugly memories of the Greek debt crisis and default in 2010-2012.Your subscription could not be saved.

SoKor lawmakers move to impeach Yoon over martial law decree,"President Yoon Suk Yeol’s surprise live TV address plunged South Korea into chaos on Tuesday night. —YonhapSEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea’s opposition parties submitted on Wednesday a motion to impeach President Yoon Suk-yeol over the shocking and short-lived martial law that drew heavily armed troops to encircle parliament before lawmakers climbed walls to reenter the building and unanimously voted to lift his order.Impeaching Yoon would require the support of two-thirds of parliament and at least six justices of the nine-member Constitutional Court would have to support it to remove him from office.Article continues after this advertisementThe motion, submitted jointly by the main opposition Democratic Party and five smaller opposition parties, could be put to a vote as early as Friday.FEATURED STORIESGLOBALNATIONAbducted US vlogger believed dead, body still missing – policeGLOBALNATIONUS Court warns PH defendants in Bangladesh heist to answer rapsGLOBALNATIONTrump names billionaire private astronaut as next Nasa chiefREAD:South Korea lifts martial law decree after lawmakers vote against itExplain decision“The parliament should focus on immediately suspending the president’s business to pass an impeachment bill soonest,” Hwang Un-ha, one of the members of parliament in the coalition, told reporters.Article continues after this advertisementRuling People Power Party chair Han Dong-hun also demanded that Yoon explain his decision, fire Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, who he said recommended the martial law decree to Yoon, and for the entire Cabinet to resign.Article continues after this advertisementSouth Korean media reported that presidential advisers and secretaries for Yoon offered to resign and Yoon also put off his official schedule on Wednesday morning.Article continues after this advertisement“President Yoon Suk-yeol’s martial law declaration was a clear violation of the Constitution. It didn’t abide by any requirements to declare it,” the Democratic Party said in a statement. “His martial law declaration was originally invalid and a grave violation of the Constitution. It was a grave act of rebellion and provides perfect grounds for his impeachment.”“Even if martial law is lifted, he cannot avoid treason charges. It was clearly revealed to the entire nation that President Yoon could no longer run the country normally. He should step down,” senior Democratic Party member of parliament Park Chan-dae said in a statement.Article continues after this advertisementSTANDOFF Soldiers try to enter the National Assembly building in Seoul on Dec. 4 after President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law. Chaotic scenes ensued as parliamentary aides sprayed fire extinguishers to push the soldiers back, and protesters scuffled with police outside as helicopters hovered above. —Agence France-PresseImpeachment processImpeaching him would require support from 200 of the 300 members of parliament. The Democratic Party and other small opposition parties together have 192 seats. But when the parliament rejected Yoon’s martial law declaration in a 190-0 vote, about 10 lawmakers from Yoon’s ruling People Power Party cast ballots supporting the rejection, according to National Assembly officials.If Yoon is impeached, he will be stripped of his constitutional powers until the Constitutional Court can rule on his fate. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the No. 2 position in the South Korean government, would take over his presidential responsibilities.Under South Korea’s Constitution, the president can declare martial law during “wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states” that require the use of military force to restrict the freedom of the press, assembly and other rights to maintain order.The Constitution also states that the president must oblige when the National Assembly demands the lifting of martial law with a majority vote.There have been more than a dozen instances of martial law being declared since South Korea was established as a republic in 1948.BacklashThe crisis in a country that has been a democracy since the 1980s, and is a US ally and major Asian economy, caused international alarm.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he welcomed Yoon’s decision to rescind the martial law declaration.South Korea hosts around 28,500 American troops as a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War.Planned defense talks and joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States were postponed, the Yonhap news agency reported.More protests were expected on Wednesday with South Korea’s largest union coalition, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, planning to hold a rally in Seoul and vowing to strike until Yoon resigns.Surprise declarationOn Tuesday night, Yoon told the nation in a TV address that martial law was needed to defend the country from nuclear-armed North Korea and pro-North antistate forces, and protect its free constitutional order, although he cited no specific threats.Yoon’s government and ruling party have been embroiled in an impasse with the Democratic Party over next year’s budget bill and a Democratic Party-led attempt to to impeach three top prosecutors.During his televised announcement, Yoon also described the opposition as “shameless pro-North Korean antistate forces who are plundering the freedom and happiness of our citizens.” He did not elaborate.Unpopular leaderChaotic scenes ensued as helmeted troops climbed into the parliament building through smashed windows and military helicopters hovered overhead. Parliamentary aides sprayed fire extinguishers to push the soldiers back, and protesters scuffled with police outside.But within hours of the declaration, South Korea’s parliament, with 190 of its 300 members present, unanimously passed a motion requiring martial law be lifted. The president then rescinded the declaration.Yoon, a career prosecutor, squeezed out a victory in the tightest presidential election in South Korean history in 2022, riding a wave of discontent over economic policy, scandals and gender wars.But he has been unpopular, with his support ratings hovering at around 20 percent for months.His People Power Party suffered a landslide defeat at a parliamentary election in April this year, ceding control of the unicameral assembly to opposition parties that captured nearly two-thirds of the seats.Yoon’s martial law declaration, the first of its kind in more than 40 years, harkened to South Korea’s past military-backed governments when authorities occasionally proclaimed martial law and other decrees that allowed them to station combat soldiers, tanks and armored vehicles on streets or at public places, such as schools to prevent antigovernment demonstrations.Your subscription could not be saved.

The shooter appeared to be “lying in wait for several minutes” before approaching Thompson from behind and opening fire, New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. Police had not yet established a motive.Article continues after this advertisement“Many people passed the suspect, but he appeared to wait for his intended target,” Tisch said, adding that the shooting “does not appear to be a random act of violence.”FEATURED STORIESGLOBALNATIONAbducted US vlogger believed dead, body still missing – policeGLOBALNATIONUS Court warns PH defendants in Bangladesh heist to answer rapsGLOBALNATIONTrump names billionaire private astronaut as next Nasa chiefSurveillance video reviewed by investigators shows the shooter emerging from behind a parked car, stopping and pointing a gun at Thompson’s back, holding it with two hands and firing multiple times from several feet away. The suspect continues firing, interrupted by a brief gun jam, as Thompson stumbles forward and falls to the sidewalk.

Police promised extra security for the event, which will go on as scheduled.The hotel is also a short walk from other tourist sites, including the Museum of Modern Art, and is often dense with office workers and visitors on weekday mornings. Many security cameras are nearby.“We’re encouraging New Yorkers to go about their daily lives and their daily business but to be alert,” NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey said.Investigators recovered several 9 mm shell casings from outside the hotel and a cellphone from the alleyway through which the suspect fled. They were also searching Thompson’s hotel room, interviewing his UnitedHealthcare colleagues and reviewing his social media, Kenny said.Police said the e-bike that the shooter used to ride into Central Park came from the city’s bike-share program, CitiBike. A spokesperson for Lyft, which operates the program, said the company had not yet been contacted by police.Health care giant UnitedHealth Group was holding its annual meeting with investors to update Wall Street on the company’s direction and expectations for the coming year.

"South Korean media call for Yoon Suk Yeol’s resignation, arrest","Media representatives gather outside the Korea Press Center in central Seoul on Wednesday morning to condemn President Yoon’s declaration of martial law last night. (Moon Ki-hoon/The Korea Herald)SEOUL — “This is no mere criticism — we’re waging war against President Yoon Suk Yeol.”These words rang out outside the Korea Press Center in central Seoul Wednesday morning, where media representatives had gathered to condemn Yoon’s overnight attempt to place press operations under military control as part of his extraordinary emergency martial law decree. The press conference reaffirmed the media’s unequivocal opposition to the martial law decree that, though short-lived, brought sudden chaos and threw South Korea’s democratic principles into question.Article continues after this advertisementDozens of journalists and officials from an alliance of eight major news media organizations assembled for an emergency press conference, delivering a series of strongly worded statements demanding Yoon’s immediate resignation and arrest.FEATURED STORIESGLOBALNATIONAbducted US vlogger believed dead, body still missing – policeGLOBALNATIONUS Court warns PH defendants in Bangladesh heist to answer rapsGLOBALNATIONTrump names billionaire private astronaut as next Nasa chiefREAD:What next for South Korea’s Yoon after failed martial law attempt?Yoon’s martial law decree, issued Tuesday at 10:23 p.m. and rescinded at 4:26 a.m. after the National Assembly voted to revoke it, imposed sweeping restrictions on civil liberties. Most alarming to press freedom advocates were provisions placing all media under direct military control and banning activities deemed as “manipulation of public opinion.”Article continues after this advertisementThe decree’s second and third provisions placed all media under martial law control, banning activities deemed as “manipulation of public opinion” — effectively putting all press operations under direct military command.Article continues after this advertisementHowever, South Korean journalists immediately stood defiant. Within hours, an alliance of eight major media organizations, including press unions and journalist associations, issued a scathing joint statement demanding Yoon’s resignation.Article continues after this advertisementThe morning press conference doubled down on that earlier joint statement issued at 12:40 a.m. Wednesday, which had branded the martial law “a gross assault on the country’s hard-earned democratic achievements” and “a declaration of war against critical media and the public at large.”READ:What unfolded on Tuesday night in Seoul: A timelineArticle continues after this advertisementThe organizations specifically condemned the decree’s media restrictions. “This anachronistic, unconstitutional attempt to ban political assembly and control media shows the Yoon government has deviated into a full-blown dictatorship,” they stated.“We never imagined the specter of martial law and dictatorship would return at the hands of our commander in chief,” said Jeon Dae-sik, vice chair of the National Union of Media Workers, which represents 15,000 members in the news industry. Speaking after several other media officials delivered remarks, Jeon read a collective statement demanding that “President Yoon step down and face punishment for his unconstitutional declaration of martial law that threatened democracy and press freedom.”For South Korean journalists, the decree evoked dark memories of press suppression under former President Chun Doo-hwan’s 1980 martial law declaration, which preceded the violent crackdown on protesters in Gwangju. Court documents from Chun’s 1997 trial revealed his regime’s systematic control: Military officials occupied newsrooms, journalists were blacklisted and media outlets were forced to merge.The 1997 trials of Chun and top officials specifically cited these media crackdowns as examples of “subverting the Constitution” — establishing a legal precedent that using martial law to control media constitutes insurrection.Press unites in condemnationYoon’s withdrawal of martial law was broadcast live at 4:26 a.m. Wednesday, too late to be reflected in the editorials of most morning papers. In a rare show of unity across South Korea’s typically polarized media landscape, both progressive and conservative outlets uniformly condemned Yoon’s action.The left-leaning Hankyoreh ran a front-page editorial titled “Yoon’s Martial Rule is Treason Against the People,” warning that confrontation with civilians would “invite historical punishment.” Kyunghyang Sinmun and Hankook Ilbo struck similar tones, emphasizing the decree’s unconstitutionality.Conservative outlets offered no defense. The center-right JoongAng Ilbo expressed shock, observing that “Yoon may have gone down an irrevocable path.” Its editorial drew explicit parallels to the Chun era, noting that using military force to resolve political disputes “invokes the nightmare” of those dark days. Dong-A Ilbo characterized the move as “turning back the clock on 40 years of Korea’s democratic accomplishment.”Even Chosun Ilbo, the country’s leading conservative outlet, usually sympathetic to Yoon, called the move “political self-harm” on its front page, warning it would spark renewed impeachment efforts from the opposition. In an analysis piece, the paper questioned the martial law decree’s legitimacy, citing sources that noted “due process stipulated by the constitution seems to have not been followed,” and concluding “it is difficult to say the martial law is legitimate.”Your subscription could not be saved.

I agree to theTerms of Useand acknowledge that I have read thePrivacy Policy.Yet Chosun Ilbo’s editorial struck a markedly different tone from other major outlets. While calling Yoon’s announcement “unwarranted” and “mind-boggling,” it devoted substantial space to explaining Yoon’s rationale. The paper echoed claims from Yoon’s televised martial law declaration that the Democratic Party of Korea’s impeachment efforts were “paralyzing administrative power,” suggesting the president “could have felt aggrieved,” though he clearly overstepped the bounds of his authority by declaring martial law.READ NEXTEmbassies in Seoul urge citizens to stay vigilant, avoid mass ...Senate body recommends random foreigner ID checks in high-risk...EDITORS' PICKLRT, MRT announce train schedule for the holiday seasonLeclerc brothers Charles, Arthur in F1 practice first at FerrariLegarda cites importance of PH Studies coursesInflation quickens to 2.5% in NovemberPadilla seeks to penalize deliberate use of fake addresses in subpoenasMaris Racal, Anthony Jennings’ ‘betrayal’ sparks celeb reactionsMOST READPacquiao to make a comeback with 1-Pacman in his cornerMaris Racal, Anthony Jennings’ 'betrayal' sparks celeb reactionsOVP: Imee Marcos helped Sara Duterte get nod to watch over staff at VMMCWest PH Sea: Japan grants Philippines funding to boost naval capabilitiesView comments",globalnation /Asia & PacificAsia & Pacific,2024-12-05

Russia’s UN envoy accuses Ukraine of aiding Syria rebels,"Syrian Kurds fleeing areas north of Aleppo arrive in Tabaqah, on the western outskirts of Raqa, on December 3, 2024. Agence France-PresseUNITED NATIONS — Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations on Tuesday accused Ukrainian intelligence services of aiding rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government, saying some fighters were “openly flaunting” the association.Rebels fighting with Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) “have not only not concealed the fact that they are supported by Ukraine, but they are also openly flaunting this,” Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council. Russia is an ally of Syria.Article continues after this advertisementThe envoy said there was an “identifiable trail” showing Ukraine’s GUR military intelligence service was providing weapons to fighters in northwest Syria.FEATURED STORIESGLOBALNATIONAbducted US vlogger believed dead, body still missing – policeGLOBALNATIONUS Court warns PH defendants in Bangladesh heist to answer rapsGLOBALNATIONTrump names billionaire private astronaut as next Nasa chiefREAD:Syria’s embattled Assad seeks to shore up support after Aleppo loss“Ukrainian military instructors from the GUR are present… training HTS fighters for combat operations,” including against Russian troops in Syria, said Nebenzia.Article continues after this advertisementA renewed offensive in the past week, led by HTS and its allies, has seen a massive shift in the long-frozen frontlines of Syria’s civil war, with the Islamist-led rebels advancing on Syria’s fourth-largest city Hama after capturing Aleppo.Article continues after this advertisementRussia’s 2015 intervention in the Syrian civil war turned the tide in the Assad government’s favor.Article continues after this advertisementAmid the new offensive, a statement from Syria’s army command said its forces were striking “terrorist organizations” in north Hama and Idlib provinces, with Russian air support.‘Utterly failed’Nebenzia also criticized UN officials for being “unable to summon the courage to call a spade a spade and to condemn these terrorist attacks” against Syria.Article continues after this advertisementREAD:Who are the former jihadists now holding Syria’s Aleppo?Deputy US ambassador Robert Wood refuted the criticism, saying: “the fact that HTS is listed as a terrorist organization by the US and UN does not justify the further atrocities by the Assad regime and its Russian backers.”Raed Saleh, director of the so-called White Helmets rescue group that operates in rebel-held parts of Syria, accused the international community of having “utterly failed the Syrian people.”“The Syrian people have appealed to you to take immediate action to end atrocities and ensure peace…however, in recent years, you have not only failed to heed these calls, but, tragically, many of your governments have chosen to forget Syria altogether,” he said to the Security Council.Saleh called out Moscow, urging it to end support for the Syrian government and for spreading “misinformation related to the White Helmets.”Ukraine’s foreign ministry said Monday that Russia and Iran — both supporters of Assad’s hardline rule — “bear the main responsibility” for the recent escalation in fighting.Kyiv hit out at Assad for recognizing Moscow’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014, and said Ukrainians were also being targeted on a nightly basis by Iranian-designed drones.Your subscription could not be saved.

What we know about South Korea’s martial law,"People gather to demand South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol to step down in front of the National Assembly in Seoul, South Korea, Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. Associated PressSEOUL — South Korea’s President Yoon Suk Yeol on Tuesday said he would liftmartial law just hours after he imposed it, in a brief and confusing episode in which he blasted the opposition as “anti-state forces” threatening the country’s democracy.The unexpected move from Yoon — the first time martial law has been declared in South Korea in more than four decades — alarmed the United States and the country’s other allies.Article continues after this advertisementREAD:South Korea lifts martial law decree after lawmakers vote against itFEATURED STORIESGLOBALNATIONAbducted US vlogger believed dead, body still missing – policeGLOBALNATIONUS Court warns PH defendants in Bangladesh heist to answer rapsGLOBALNATIONTrump names billionaire private astronaut as next Nasa chiefWhat do we know about the imposition, its lifting and what might come next?What was the declaration?In a dramatic, late-night emergency television address to the nation, Yoon announced that he was imposing martial law in South Korea, as he accused the opposition of paralysing the government with “anti-state activities”.Article continues after this advertisementA six-point decree from the new martial law commander, army chief General Park An-su swiftly followed, banning political activities and parties, “false propaganda”, strikes and “gatherings that incite social unrest”.Article continues after this advertisementThe order also brought all media outlets under the authority of martial law and directed all medical staff, including striking doctors, to return to work within 48 hours.Article continues after this advertisementWhat happened at parliament?Security forces sealed the National Assembly, helicopters landed on the roof and troops entered the building for a short time, seemingly in a bid to prevent lawmakers from getting inside.READ:South Korean parliament defies president, lifts martial law declarationArticle continues after this advertisementBut 190 lawmakers managed to enter and voted unanimously to reject Yoon’s declaration and call for martial law to be lifted.Outside, hundreds of protesters gathered, many raising chants calling for Yoon to be arrested.What happened next?Following the lawmakers’ vote, Yoon backed down. His cabinet additionally approved the motion to lift the order, Yonhap news agency reported.“Just a moment ago, there was a demand from the National Assembly to lift the state of emergency, and we have withdrawn the military that was deployed for martial law operations,” Yoon said in a televised address around 4:30 am (1930 GMT Tuesday).Under South Korea’s constitution, the parliamentary vote to lift martial law has to be respected.Why did Yoon do this?Yoon said he was acting to safeguard his country’s liberal democracy from “anti-state elements” and “threats posed by North Korea” — but gave little detail.While unexpected, the announcement came in the context of a festering budget row between Yoon and the opposition Democratic Party.The opposition has slashed around 4.1 trillion won ($2.8 billion) from Yoon’s proposed 677 trillion won budget for next year, prompting the president to complain that “all key budgets essential to the nation’s core functions” were being cut.“What is clear is that Yoon has been a deeply unpopular, ineffectual leader and he is having a hard time getting any kind of public support for anything he’s trying to do,” said Alan Yu, a former US diplomat in Asia now at the Center for American Progress.“The use of martial law feels almost like a desperation move to try to break out, both in a political and policy sense, but it is really poorly played on both fronts.”What is next for Yoon?Domestically, pressure has only grown further on Yoon after his late-night bombshell.South Korea’s main opposition party has demanded that Yoon step down, accusing him of “insurrection”.The country’s main labor union group has also called an “indefinite general strike” until he resigns over the “irrational and anti-democratic measure”.Yoon’s own People Power Party described his attempt at imposing martial law as “tragic” and demanded that those involved be held accountable.What has the reaction been abroad?South Korea is a key Western ally in Asia, seen as an important democratic bulwark in a region dominated by authoritarian regimes, and the drama is being watched with concern.READ:US ‘relieved’ S.

Yoon insisted it would have been rude to refuse.His mother-in-law, Choi Eun-soon, is serving a one-year prison sentence for forging financial documents in a real estate deal. She is due to be released in July.Yoon was earlier this year the subject of a petition calling for his impeachment, which proved so popular the parliamentary website hosting it experienced delays and crashes.Local media have reported that Yoon is particularly inspired by British wartime prime minister Winston Churchill.As president, Yoon has maintained a tough stance against Pyongyang and bolstered ties with Seoul’s traditional ally, the United States.Last year, he famously sang Don McLean’s “American Pie” during his visit to the White House, to which US President Joe Biden responded, “I had no damn idea you could sing.”But his efforts to restore ties with South Korea’s former colonial ruler, Japan, did not sit well with many at home, as the issue remains sensitive in the country.Your subscription could not be saved.

South Korea lifts martial law decree after lawmakers vote against it,"People gather to demand South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol to step down in front of the National Assembly in Seoul, South Korea, Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. —Kim Do-hoon/Yonhap via APSEOUL, South Korea — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s government early Wednesday lifted the martial law he imposed during a tense night of political drama in which troops surrounded parliament and lawmakers voted to reject military rule.Police and military personnel were seen leaving the grounds of parliament following the bipartisan vote, and the declaration was formally lifted around 4:30 a.m. during a Cabinet meeting.Article continues after this advertisementYoon imposed martial law late Tuesday, vowing to eliminate “anti-state” forces as he struggles against an opposition that controls parliament and that he accuses of sympathizing with communist North Korea.FEATURED STORIESGLOBALNATIONAbducted US vlogger believed dead, body still missing – policeGLOBALNATIONUS Court warns PH defendants in Bangladesh heist to answer rapsGLOBALNATIONTrump names billionaire private astronaut as next Nasa chiefREAD:South Korean president declares emergency martial lawLess than three hours later, parliament acted, with National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik declaring that the martial law was “invalid” and that lawmakers “will protect democracy with the people.”Article continues after this advertisementThe president’s surprising move harkened back to an era of authoritarian leaders that the country has not seen since the 1980s, and it was immediately denounced by the opposition and the leader of Yoon’s own party.Article continues after this advertisementLee Jae-myung, leader of the liberal Democratic Party, which holds the majority in the 300-seat parliament, said the party’s lawmakers would remain in the Assembly’s main hall until Yoon formally lifted his order.Article continues after this advertisementWoo applauded how troops quickly left the Assembly after the vote.Article continues after this advertisement“Even with our unfortunate memories of military coups, our citizens have surely observed the events of today and saw the maturity of our military,” Woo said.While announcing his plan to lift martial law, Yoon continued to criticize parliament’s attempts to impeach key government officials and senior prosecutors and lawmakers’ “unscrupulous acts of legislative and budgetary manipulation that are paralyzing the functions of the state.”Jo Seung-lae, a Democratic lawmaker, claimed that security camera footage following Yoon’s declaration showed that troops moved in a way that suggested they were trying to arrest Lee, Woo and even Han Dong-hoon, the leader of Yoon’s People Power Party.Officials from Yoon’s office and the Defense Ministry did not respond to requests for comment early Wednesday.Seemingly hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the Assembly, waving banners and calling for Yoon’s impeachment.Some protesters scuffled with troops ahead of the lawmakers’ vote, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or major property damage. At least one window was broken as troops attempted to enter the Assembly building. One woman tried unsuccessfully to pull a rifle away from one of the soldiers, while shouting “Aren’t you embarrassed?”Under South Korea’s constitution, the president can declare martial law during “wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states” that require the use of military force to maintain peace and order. It was questionable whether South Korea is currently in such a state.When martial law is declared, “special measures” can be employed to restrict the freedom of press, freedom of assembly and other rights, as well as the power of courts.The constitution also states that the president must oblige when the National Assembly demands the lifting of martial law with a majority vote.Following Yoon’s announcement, South Korea’s military proclaimed that parliament and other political gatherings that could cause “social confusion” would be suspended, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said. The military said anyone who violates the decree could be arrested without a warrant.In Washington, the White House said the US was “seriously concerned” by the events in Seoul. A spokesperson for the National Security Council said President Joe Biden’s administration was not notified in advance of the martial law announcement and was in contact with the South Korean government.Speaking at an event with Japan’s ambassador to Washington, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, a longtime Asia diplomat, reiterated that the US-South Korea alliance is “ironclad” and the US would “stand by Korea in their time of uncertainty.”Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said there was no effect on the more than 27,000 US service members based in South Korea. They are not confined to base or under any type of curfew, Ryder said.The South Korean military also said that the country’s striking doctors should return to work within 48 hours, Yonhap said. Thousands of doctors have been striking for months over government plans to expand the number of students at medical schools.Soon after the declaration, the parliament speaker called on his YouTube channel for all lawmakers to gather at the National Assembly. He urged military and law enforcement personnel to “remain calm and hold their positions.All 190 lawmakers who participated in the vote supported the lifting of martial law. Television footage showed soldiers who had been stationed at parliament leaving the site after the vote.Hours earlier, TV showed police officers blocking the entrance of the National Assembly and helmeted soldiers carrying rifles in front of the building.An Associated Press photographer saw at least three helicopters, likely from the military, that landed inside the Assembly grounds, while two or three helicopters circled above the site.The leader of Yoon’s conservative People Power Party called the decision to impose martial law “wrong” and vowed to “stop it with the people.” Lee, who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, said Yoon’s announcement was “illegal and unconstitutional.”Yoon said during a televised speech that martial law would help “rebuild and protect” the country from “falling into the depths of national ruin.” He said he would “eradicate pro-North Korean forces and protect the constitutional democratic order.”“I will eliminate anti-state forces as quickly as possible and normalize the country,” he said, while asking the people to believe in him and tolerate “some inconveniences.”Yoon—whose approval rating has dipped in recent months—has struggled to push his agenda against an opposition-controlled parliament since taking office in 2022.Yoon’s party has been locked in an impasse with the liberal opposition over next year’s budget bill. The opposition has also attempted to pass motions to impeach three top prosecutors, including the chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office, in what the conservatives have called a vendetta against their criminal investigations of Lee, who has been seen as the favorite for the next presidential election in 2027 in opinion polls.During his televised announcement, Yoon also described the opposition as “shameless pro-North Korean anti-state forces who are plundering the freedom and happiness of our citizens,” but he did not elaborate.Yoon has taken a hard line on North Korea over its nuclear ambitions, departing from the policies of his liberal predecessor, Moon Jae-in, who pursued inter-Korean engagement.Yoon has also dismissed calls for independent investigations into scandals involving his wife and top officials, drawing quick, strong rebukes from his political rivals.Yoon’s move was the first declaration of martial law since the country’s democratization in 1987. The country’s last previous martial law was in October 1979, following the assassination of former military dictator Park Chung-hee.Sydney Seiler, Korean chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, argued that the move was symbolic for Yoon to express his frustration with the opposition-controlled parliament.“He has nothing to lose,” said Seiler, comparing Yoon’s move to the Hail Mary pass in American football, where he hoped for a slim chance of success.Now Yoon is likely to be impeached, a scenario that was also possible before he made the bold move, Seiler said.Natalia Slavney, research analyst at the Stimson Center’s 38 North website that focuses on Korean affairs, said Yoon’s imposition of martial law was “a serious backslide of democracy” that followed a “worrying trend of abuse” since he took office in 2022.Your subscription could not be saved.

BI eyes case vs Roque for leaving PH illegally,"WHEN HARRY LEFT PH Former presidential spokesperson Harry Roque confirms his departure from the country during a Zoom interview with reporters on Tuesday. The Bureau of Immigration says he may have gotten help from “unscrupulous individuals.” —ScreengrabMANILA, Philippines — The legal team of the Bureau of Immigration (BI) is looking into the filing of charges against former presidential spokesperson Harry Roque, who may have left the country illegally.Hours after Roque confirmed on Tuesday that he had gone to Abu Dhabi solely to have his counteraffidavit for the qualified human trafficking case against him notarized, Immigration Commissioner Joel Anthony Viado said their records showed no recent attempt by Roque to leave the country through official channels. His last recorded travel was in July when he returned from the United States.Article continues after this advertisement“It’s impossible that he left through formal ports. His name is in the BI’s lookout bulletin, and he is a very well-known public figure. You can spot him miles away,” Viado said.FEATURED STORIESGLOBALNATIONAbducted US vlogger believed dead, body still missing – policeGLOBALNATIONUS Court warns PH defendants in Bangladesh heist to answer rapsGLOBALNATIONTrump names billionaire private astronaut as next Nasa chiefREAD:Harry Roque, wife ‘appear to be staying in UAE legally’ – DFAThe Department of Justice (DOJ) issued on Aug. 6 an immigration lookout bulletin order against Roque and 11 other persons of interest who were linked to Lucky South 99 Corp., a Philippine offshore gaming operator (Pogo) hub that was raided by authorities in Porac, Pampanga, in June for alleged human trafficking and other illegal activities.Article continues after this advertisement“Flight is evidence of guilt. He likely left the country through illegal means, possibly with the assistance of unscrupulous individuals,” Viado added.Article continues after this advertisementPotential casesThe BI chief alleged that Roque may have falsified immigration clearances to gain entry into his destination country, adding that their legal team was considering filing charges for falsification of public documents, along with other potential offenses.Article continues after this advertisementSpeaking to reporters via Zoom, Roque said he submitted his counteraffidavit to the DOJ through his lawyers also on Tuesday, adding that he swore to the document’s authenticity before the Philippine consulate in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.“I went to Abu Dhabi to have it subscribed, but I’m no longer in Abu Dhabi,” Roque clarified, saying he remains outside the country.Article continues after this advertisementThe qualified human trafficking case is still under preliminary investigation by the DOJ, and Roque, who served under former President Rodrigo Duterte, has not been formally indicted.According to Prosecutor General Richard Fadullon, Roque’s counteraffidavit was notarized on Nov. 29.However, before accepting the submission, the panel of prosecutors decided to offer Roque the opportunity to attend a clarificatory hearing, which would be scheduled before Dec. 16, to address certain issues and confirm his whereabouts.“We do not know if he has a private lawyer. But apparently, he would have been assisted by one when he executed the affidavit because the counteraffidavit he submitted bears a stamp,” Fadullon explained.Panel’s dilemma“Unfortunately, we have no way of verifying whether these documents can be considered for resolving the case since they are not apostilled (accompanied by a certificate that authenticates the origin of a public document),” he added.The qualified human trafficking complaint against those linked to the Porac Pogo hub was filed initially on Sept. 10, but Roque was added as a respondent only on Oct. 28 after the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission and Philippine National Police submitted a 15-page supplemental complaint affidavit implicating him.The complaint alleged that Roque, listed as the legal officer of Lucky South 99, benefited from human trafficking operations and other illegal activities but chose to remain silent.Your subscription could not be saved.
